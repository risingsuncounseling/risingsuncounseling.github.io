Alpacas can form strong bonds with humans and enjoy being around people. They are known to be curious animals and will often approach people to investigate and interact with them. 

Alpacas are social animals and have a strong sense of community. In their natural habitat, alpacas live in herds and rely on each other for protection and companionship. They are known to hum, softly cluck, and even kiss each other on the cheeks to communicate and show affection. Interestingly, alpacas also have a communal dung pile that they use as a shared toilet. This helps them keep their living area clean and reduce the spread of parasites and diseases.
