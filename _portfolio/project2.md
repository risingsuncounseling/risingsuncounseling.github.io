Interacting with trained therapy dogs can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression while promoting a sense of calm and well-being. From hospitals to schools, these furry friends bring comfort, promote social interaction, and even assist in physical rehabilitation. Let the wagging tails and wet noses of therapy dogs create moments of joy and transformation on your therapeutic journey.

These gentle and intuitive creatures provide emotional support, companionship, and unconditional love to individuals in therapeutic settings. Research shows that therapy dog visits have been associated with a significant reduction in anxiety levels by up to 24% (Source: Marcus, S. et al., 2012). Additionally, studies have shown that petting a dog can lead to increased levels of oxytocin, a hormone associated with bonding and relaxation (Source: Beetz, A. et al., 2012). From hospitals to schools, these furry friends bring comfort, promote social interaction, and even assist in physical rehabilitation. Let the wagging tails and wet noses of therapy dogs create moments of joy and transformation on your therapeutic journey.
