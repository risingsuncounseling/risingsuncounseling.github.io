Alpacas are social animals that enjoy the company of other alpacas and can also benefit from human companionship. While alpacas can live in herds, they are also capable of forming close bonds with individual humans. Alpacas have been known to follow their favorite human around, seek out human attention and affection, and even show signs of distress when separated from their human friends. In addition, alpacas are very observant animals that are sensitive to human emotions and body language, which allows them to respond to and comfort their human companions in unique ways.
